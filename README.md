### Notes on configuration
When running the application you'll need to ensure you have your .env file setup in the root folder.  Credential configuration files should be kept private.

The application looks for configuration in:
```
/.env
```

To get started quickly just copy the sample to .env and edit from there

**Mac/Linux**
```
cp .env.sample .env
```

**Windows**
```
xcopy .env.sample .env
```

The .env file should look like the code block below, with your own valid keys added you can reference /.env.sample
```

### To Run Locally

Create a valid .env configuration file (see above).

Make sure you have all the required python libraries installed.

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you can run your application

```sh
python3 bot.py
```

Once your app is running you should be good to go. You can message your bot directly on slack, or you can invite him to a channel and @botname {text goes here} to use it.

---

### To Run on Bluemix

```
cf push $YOUR_APP_NAME_HERE --no-route true --health-check-type process -m 256M
```

or potentially... (depending on your CLI tools)

```
bx cf push $YOUR_APP_NAME_HERE --no-route true --health-check-type process -m 256M
```

Once your app is finished staging you should be good to go. You can message your bot directly on slack, or you can invite him to a channel and @botname {text goes here} to use it.

# Running Tests

The following line will run all the unit tests.

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover
```

You can run a specific test with a command like below

# Logging

## General Logs

All chat logs are stored in the /slackbot.log file, mostly consisting of user utterances, responses, and slack logging.

## Analytics

Slackbot has built in hooks for enabling analytics, such as dashbot.io, by setting `ANALYTICS_ENABLED` to TRUE and adding in your dashbot.io API Key you can start easily start posting to the service

Refer to the .env.sample if needed.


# Context

The slackbot also has the option to send up context as JSON. You can find this in the `context.json` file in the root directory. The file **must be** valid JSON and will be sent as part of the body to WA. This is useful for one your skills/skillSets require context such as location with a lat long.
